------------------- INSTRUCTIONS -----------------------

Download the FLAME Dataset:
  Go to https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/flame-dataset-aerial-imagery-pile-burn-detection-using-drones-uavs#files
  Download both Training_Validation images for Fire_vs_NoFire image classification and Test images for Fire_vs_NoFire image classification.
  Unzip the files
  Check the paths from both folders. They are required for the code.
  
Inside the IDE:
  Make sure to have the libraries installed.
  Copy and paste the given code.
  In the secction "Directories of Data", change variables d_training and d_test, for the directories in which you saved the folders of Train and Test.
  Run the code.
  
 ------------------- Description -----------------------
  
  Data Visualization:
    Code use to inspect the training/test dataset after and before the augmentation process.
    
  VGG_Model:
    This code corresponds to the load, split, and augment of the data, and the train, validation and test process of the pretrained model. 
    
  VGG20_Model:
    Because the zip file of the trained model is huge, I will provide a text file containing a link to a downloadable zip file within my personal google drive.
